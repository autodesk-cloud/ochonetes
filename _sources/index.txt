Ochonetes
_________

Ochonotes is a little add-on you can drop onto your Kubernetes_ cluster to quickly get started with Ochopod_. It
comes with a little web-shell and provides lean remoting as well. We embed a bunch of tools that allow you to list,
query, deploy and shutdown your Ochopod_ containers.

It is 100% made of Python_ with a dash of JQuery_ for the web-shell !
