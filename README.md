## Ochonetes

### Overview

This project is a small development PaaS leveraging [**Ochopod**](https://github.com/autodesk-cloud/ochopod)
and overlaying it on top of [**Kubernetes**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes).

It provides a self-contained web-shell ([**JQuery**](https://jquery.com/) rocks !) hosting our little toolkit that will
allow you to create, query and manage your ochopod containers. It also lets you CURL your commands directly which is
a great way to build your CI/CD pipeline !

Please note we **only support bindings to run over AWS** at this point.

### Getting started

#### Step 1 : install K8S on AWS

You know how to do it. Just peruse their [**AWS guide**](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/getting-started-guides/aws.md)
that will get you setup in minutes.

Note what the master IP is and what your credentials. These can be found locally, for instance:

```
$ cat ~/.kube/kubernetes/kubernetes_auth
```

#### Step 2 : deploy our proxy

We use a simple proxy mechanism to interact with our containers. Edit the provided ```ocho-proxy.yml``` and specify
the master IP and user credentials. Then create the pod:

```
$ kubectl create -f ocho-proxy.yml
```

Wait a bit until the pod is up and note the public IP it is running on. This IP will be the only thing you need to
access from now on. You can easily firewall it depending on your needs. Simply use your browser and look the proxy
node IP up on port 9000. You should see our little web-shell (notice the elegant ascii art).

### The CLI

You are now all setup and can remotely issue commands to the proxy. Are you afraid of using CURL or feel lazy ? No
problemo, use our little self-contained CLI ! You just need to have [**Python 2.7+**](https://www.python.org/)
installed locally:

```
$ chmod +x cli.py
$ ./cli.py <PROXY NODE IP>
welcome to the ocho CLI ! (CTRL-C to exit)
>
```

Any command typed in that interactive session will be relayed to your proxy ! If you prefer to CURL directory you
can do so as well.

### Deploying your first containers

Go ahead and use the CLI to deploy a 3 node [**Zookeeper**](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) ensemble ! Look at the
little ```zookeeper.yml```. This is the container definition you are going to send to the proxy for deployment.
The proxy will then setup the corresponding k8s infrastructure (replication controller & pods) for you and ochopod will
automatically cluster those pods into a functional cross-configured ensemble. If you are a nerd please have a look at
```images/zookeeper``` to see what is hiding in our image.

Let us get going with the CLI:

```
> deploy zookeeper.yml -p 3
100% success / spawned 3 pod(s)
```

This is it ! Your ensemble is booting. Wait a bit for the cluster to settle and poof you will have a nice ensemble
you can access at TCP 2181 !

### Documentation

You can [**peruse our online documentation**](http://autodesk-cloud.github.io/ochonetes/) for examples, design notes
and more !

The [**Sphinx**](http://sphinx-doc.org/) materials can be found under docs/. Just go in there and build for your
favorite target, for instance:

```
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

The docs will be written to _docs/_build/html_. This is all Sphinx based and you have many options and knobs to
tweak should you want to customize the output.
